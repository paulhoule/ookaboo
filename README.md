ookaboo
=======

trouble tickets and end-user documentation related to [Ookaboo](http://ookaboo.com/).

This project also contains the source code for software related to Ookaboo that can be open-sourced.  In the
immediate term these projects are research subjects that will feed into the 
[pandaemonium](https://github.com/paulhoule/pandaemonium) project once I learn enough to generalize them,
in the future these should be dependent on pandaemonium
